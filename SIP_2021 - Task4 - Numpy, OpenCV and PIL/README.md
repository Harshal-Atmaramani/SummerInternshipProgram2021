### We have used Google Colaboratory to do the task since it is collaborative and uses cloud resources to process the code. If you intend to use the code in this repository, kindly make sure either to use Google Colaboratory or make necessary changes so as to use in Jupyter Notebook.

### Some point of differences between Google Colaboratory and Jupyter Notebook are listed below:

1. from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow is equal to import cv2 in Jupyter NB.
2. cv2_imread in Colab is equal to cv2.imread in Jupyter NB.
3. cv2_imshow in Colab is equal to three statements in Jupyter NB.
    cv2.imshow('Img_Name', arr_var)
    cv2.waitKey()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
